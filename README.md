# AutoToDo
A todo app automatically created by AI starting from just a readme file. It lets you create, read, update and delete Todos with a graphical UI.

## Features
- ✅ Create new todos with a simple form
- ✅ View all todos in a clean, organized list
- ✅ Search todos by keywords in real-time
- ✅ Edit existing todos inline
- ✅ Delete todos with confirmation dialog
- ✅ Mark todos as completed with checkboxes
- ✅ Data persistence using localStorage
- ✅ Responsive design with modern UI

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Add new todos using the input field at the top
3. Use the search field to filter todos by keywords
4. Click checkboxes to mark todos as completed
5. Use Edit buttons to modify todo text
6. Use Delete buttons to remove todos (with confirmation)

## Bug Fix
Fixed the issue where users were unable to delete todos using the graphical UI. The delete functionality now works correctly with:
- Proper event binding for delete buttons
- Confirmation dialogs for safety
- Correct removal from both DOM and localStorage
- UI updates after deletion
