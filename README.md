# AutoToDo
A todo app automatically created by AI starting from just a readme file. It lets you create, read, update and delete Todos with a graphical UI.

## Installation

AutoToDo is a simple, self-contained web application that runs entirely in your browser. No server setup or package installation required!

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, or any browser with JavaScript support)
- No additional software or dependencies needed

### Quick Start

#### Option 1: Download and Run Locally
1. **Download the repository:**
   - Click the green "Code" button on the GitHub repository page
   - Select "Download ZIP" and extract the files to your desired location
   - Or clone using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/lucabol/AutoToDo.git
     cd AutoToDo
     ```

2. **Open the app:**
   - Navigate to the downloaded/cloned folder
   - Double-click on `index.html` to open it in your default browser
   - Or right-click `index.html` and select "Open with" → your preferred browser

#### Option 2: Run with Local Server (Recommended)
For the best experience and to avoid potential browser security restrictions:

1. **Using Python (if installed):**
   ```bash
   cd AutoToDo
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

2. **Using Node.js (if installed):**
   ```bash
   cd AutoToDo
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

3. **Using any other local server of your choice**

### Browser Compatibility

**Fully Supported (Recommended):**
- ✅ Chrome 60+ (includes localStorage, ES6 classes, CSS Grid)
- ✅ Firefox 55+ (includes CSS Grid and modern JavaScript)
- ✅ Safari 11+ (includes CSS Grid, note: localStorage restrictions in private mode)
- ✅ Edge 16+ (modern Edge with Chromium engine)
- ✅ Most modern mobile browsers (iOS 11+, Android Chrome 60+)

**Limited Support:**
- ⚠️ Internet Explorer 11: Basic functionality works, but CSS Grid may have issues
- ⚠️ Safari 9-10: Works but lacks CSS Grid support
- ⚠️ Older mobile browsers: May have touch interaction or CSS issues

**Minimum Requirements:**
- JavaScript ES6 class support
- localStorage API
- Modern DOM APIs (querySelector, addEventListener)
- CSS Flexbox support (fallback for Grid)

### Data Storage
Your todos are automatically saved in your browser's local storage. Data persists between sessions but is specific to the browser and domain where you run the app.

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Browser Compatibility Issues

##### 1. Application Loading Problems
- **App doesn't load properly when opened directly:** 
  - Try using a local server (Option 2) instead of opening the file directly
  - Modern browsers block certain features when files are opened via `file://` protocol
  - If you must open directly, try different browsers (Chrome/Edge are more restrictive than Firefox)

- **JavaScript errors on page load:**
  - Check if your browser supports ES6 classes (Chrome 49+, Firefox 45+, Safari 9+)
  - Update your browser to the latest version
  - Check browser console (F12) for specific error messages

##### 2. Data Storage Issues
- **Todos don't save or disappear after closing browser:**
  - Ensure your browser allows localStorage and you're not in private/incognito mode
  - Check if storage quota is exceeded (clear browser data if needed)
  - In Safari, enable "Prevent cross-site tracking" settings may interfere with localStorage
  - Some corporate firewalls or security software may block localStorage

- **Data loss in Safari:**
  - Safari may clear localStorage more aggressively in private browsing
  - Ensure "Prevent cross-site tracking" is configured properly
  - Try disabling "Block all cookies" in Safari preferences

##### 3. CSS Rendering Problems
- **Layout appears broken or elements are misaligned:**
  - Ensure your browser supports CSS Grid (IE 11 uses older syntax)
  - Check Flexbox support for older browsers (IE 10+, Android 4.1+)
  - Update to a modern browser version for best results

- **Mobile display issues:**
  - Ensure viewport meta tag is working (should be automatic)
  - Try rotating device orientation if layout seems cramped
  - Some older mobile browsers may not support modern CSS features

- **Font rendering problems:**
  - System fonts (-apple-system, etc.) may not load properly on older systems
  - Font fallback should work automatically, but update your OS for best results

##### 4. Security and CORS Issues
- **Mixed content warnings:**
  - Occurs when running HTTPS sites that load HTTP resources
  - Use local server or ensure all resources use the same protocol

- **File access restrictions:**
  - Some browsers prevent file:// protocol from accessing certain features
  - Use a local server (see installation options) for full functionality

##### 5. Mobile Browser Specific Issues
- **Touch interactions not working:**
  - Ensure JavaScript is enabled on mobile browser
  - Some mobile browsers may have different event handling

- **iOS Safari specific problems:**
  - Viewport scaling issues: try adding to homescreen for app-like experience
  - LocalStorage may be limited in Private Browsing mode

##### 6. Performance Issues
- **App feels slow or unresponsive:**
  - Clear browser cache and cookies
  - Ensure sufficient device memory is available
  - Try closing other browser tabs to free up resources

#### Browser-Specific Solutions

**For Internet Explorer 11:**
- CSS Grid features may not work properly
- Consider using a modern browser for best experience

**For Chrome/Chromium:**
- If local files don't work, start Chrome with `--allow-file-access-from-files` flag (not recommended for security)
- Better solution: use local server as described in installation

**For Firefox:**
- Generally more permissive with local file access
- Check `privacy.file_unique_origin` setting if issues persist

**For Safari:**
- Check "Develop" menu for JavaScript errors
- localStorage restrictions are common in private browsing

#### Getting Help
If you continue experiencing issues:
1. Check the browser console (F12 → Console tab) for error messages
2. Try the app in a different browser to isolate the problem
3. Ensure you're using a supported browser version (see Browser Compatibility section)
4. Use the local server installation method for the most reliable experience
