## Installation

AutoToDo is a simple, self-contained web application that runs entirely in your browser. No server setup or package installation required!

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, or any browser with JavaScript support)
- No additional software or dependencies needed

### Quick Start

#### Option 1: Download and Run Locally
1. **Download the repository:**
   - Click the green "Code" button on the GitHub repository page
   - Select "Download ZIP" and extract the files to your desired location
   - Or clone using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/lucabol/AutoToDo.git
     cd AutoToDo
     ```

2. **Open the app:**
   - Navigate to the downloaded/cloned folder
   - Double-click on `index.html` to open it in your default browser
   - Or right-click `index.html` and select "Open with" → your preferred browser

#### Option 2: Run with Local Server (Recommended)
For the best experience and to avoid potential browser security restrictions:

1. **Using Python (if installed):**
   ```bash
   cd AutoToDo
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

2. **Using Node.js (if installed):**
   ```bash
   cd AutoToDo
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

3. **Using any other local server of your choice**

### Browser Compatibility

**Fully Supported (Recommended):**
- ✅ Chrome 60+ (includes localStorage, ES6 classes, CSS Grid)
- ✅ Firefox 55+ (includes CSS Grid and modern JavaScript)
- ✅ Safari 11+ (includes CSS Grid, note: localStorage restrictions in private mode)
- ✅ Edge 16+ (modern Edge with Chromium engine)
- ✅ Most modern mobile browsers (iOS 11+, Android Chrome 60+)

**Limited Support:**
- ⚠️ Internet Explorer 11: Basic functionality works, but CSS Grid may have issues
- ⚠️ Safari 9-10: Works but lacks CSS Grid support
- ⚠️ Older mobile browsers: May have touch interaction or CSS issues

**Minimum Requirements:**
- JavaScript ES6 class support
- localStorage API
- Modern DOM APIs (querySelector, addEventListener)
- CSS Flexbox support (fallback for Grid)

### Data Storage
Your todos are automatically saved in your browser's local storage. Data persists between sessions but is specific to the browser and domain where you run the app.

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Browser Compatibility Issues

##### 1. Application Loading Problems
- **App doesn't load properly when opened directly:** 
  - Try using a local server (Option 2) instead of opening the file directly
  - Modern browsers block certain features when files are opened via `file://` protocol
  - If you must open directly, try different browsers (Chrome/Edge are more restrictive than Firefox)

- **JavaScript errors on page load:**
  - Check if your browser supports ES6 classes (Chrome 49+, Firefox 45+, Safari 9+)
  - Update your browser to the latest version
  - Check browser console (F12) for specific error messages

##### 2. Data Storage Issues
- **Todos don't save or disappear after closing browser:**
  - Ensure your browser allows localStorage and you're not in private/incognito mode
  - Check if storage quota is exceeded (clear browser data if needed)
  - In Safari, enable "Prevent cross-site tracking" settings may interfere with localStorage
  - Some corporate firewalls or security software may block localStorage

- **Data loss in Safari:**
  - Safari may clear localStorage more aggressively in private browsing
  - Ensure "Prevent cross-site tracking" is configured properly
  - Try disabling "Block all cookies" in Safari preferences

##### 3. CSS Rendering Problems
- **Layout appears broken or elements are misaligned:**
  - Ensure your browser supports CSS Grid (IE 11 uses older syntax)
  - Check Flexbox support for older browsers (IE 10+, Android 4.1+)
  - Update to a modern browser version for best results

- **Mobile display issues:**
  - Ensure viewport meta tag is working (should be automatic)
  - Try rotating device orientation if layout seems cramped
  - Some older mobile browsers may not support modern CSS features

- **Font rendering problems:**
  - System fonts (-apple-system, etc.) may not load properly on older systems
  - Font fallback should work automatically, but update your OS for best results

##### 4. Security and CORS Issues
- **Mixed content warnings:**
  - Occurs when running HTTPS sites that load HTTP resources
  - Use local server or ensure all resources use the same protocol

- **File access restrictions:**
  - Some browsers prevent file:// protocol from accessing certain features
  - Use a local server (see installation options) for full functionality

##### 5. Mobile Browser Specific Issues
- **Touch interactions not working:**
  - Ensure JavaScript is enabled on mobile browser
  - Some mobile browsers may have different event handling

- **iOS Safari specific problems:**
  - Viewport scaling issues: try adding to homescreen for app-like experience
  - LocalStorage may be limited in Private Browsing mode

##### 6. Performance Issues
- **App feels slow or unresponsive:**
  - Clear browser cache and cookies
  - Ensure sufficient device memory is available
  - Try closing other browser tabs to free up resources

#### Browser-Specific Solutions

**For Internet Explorer 11:**
- CSS Grid features may not work properly
- Consider using a modern browser for best experience

**For Chrome/Chromium:**
- If local files don't work, start Chrome with `--allow-file-access-from-files` flag (not recommended for security)
- Better solution: use local server as described in installation

**For Firefox:**
- Generally more permissive with local file access
- Check `privacy.file_unique_origin` setting if issues persist

**For Safari:**
- Check "Develop" menu for JavaScript errors
- localStorage restrictions are common in private browsing

#### Getting Help
If you continue experiencing issues:
1. Check the browser console (F12 → Console tab) for error messages
2. Try the app in a different browser to isolate the problem
3. Ensure you're using a supported browser version (see Browser Compatibility section)
4. Use the local server installation method for the most reliable experience

#### Actual Implementation Code Snippets

Here are detailed code snippets from the actual implementation files, including complex and context-aware shortcuts:

**1. Complex Context-Aware Shortcuts (from `js/KeyboardShortcutManager.js`):**
```javascript
// Context-aware shortcut handling with priority system
handleKeyDown(event) {
    const { key, ctrlKey, shiftKey, altKey } = event;
    
    // Find matching shortcuts for current context
    const contextShortcuts = this.shortcuts.filter(shortcut => {
        // Check if shortcut matches current context or is global
        return (shortcut.context === this.currentContext || 
                shortcut.context === 'global') &&
               shortcut.key === key &&
               Boolean(shortcut.ctrlKey) === ctrlKey &&
               Boolean(shortcut.shiftKey) === shiftKey &&
               Boolean(shortcut.altKey) === altKey;
    });
    
    // Priority: editing context > global context
    const selectedShortcut = contextShortcuts.find(s => s.context === this.currentContext) ||
                           contextShortcuts.find(s => s.context === 'global');
    
    if (selectedShortcut) {
        if (selectedShortcut.preventDefault) {
            event.preventDefault();
        }
        selectedShortcut.action();
    }
}
```

**2. Multi-Key Combination Shortcuts (from `js/ShortcutsConfig.js`):**
```javascript
// Complex modifier combinations for advanced operations
{
    key: 'd',
    ctrlKey: true,
    shiftKey: true,  // Ctrl+Shift+D
    context: 'global',
    action: clearCompleted,
    preventDefault: true,
    description: 'Clear all completed todos (Ctrl+Shift+D)',
    category: 'Todo Management',
    confirmAction: true  // Requires user confirmation
},

// Alternative shortcuts for same action
{
    key: 'Delete',
    ctrlKey: true,
    context: 'global',
    action: deleteFirstTodo,
    preventDefault: true,
    description: 'Delete first todo item (Ctrl+Delete)',
    category: 'Todo Management',
    confirmAction: true,
    // Custom validation logic
    validate: () => {
        const todos = document.querySelectorAll('.todo-item');
        return todos.length > 0; // Only active if todos exist
    }
}
```

**3. Context Switching and State Management (from `js/TodoController.js`):**
```javascript
// Edit mode activation with context switching
startEdit(todoId) {
    this.currentEditId = todoId;
    
    // Switch keyboard context to editing mode
    this.keyboardManager.setContext('editing');
    
    // Enable editing-specific shortcuts
    const editElement = document.getElementById(`todo-${todoId}`);
    editElement.classList.add('editing');
    
    // Set up edit-specific event handlers
    const input = editElement.querySelector('.edit-input');
    input.focus();
    
    // Context-aware shortcut activation
    input.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
        if (e.key === 'Escape') {
            this.cancelEdit(); // Only works in edit context
        } else if (e.key === 'Enter' || (e.key === 's' && e.ctrlKey)) {
            this.saveEdit();   // Only works in edit context
        }
    });
}

// Exit edit mode and restore global context
cancelEdit() {
    if (this.currentEditId) {
        const editElement = document.getElementById(`todo-${this.currentEditId}`);
        editElement.classList.remove('editing');
        
        // Restore global keyboard context
        this.keyboardManager.setContext('global');
        this.currentEditId = null;
        
        // Return focus to main container
        document.getElementById('todo-list').focus();
    }
}
```

**4. Advanced Search and Filter Shortcuts (from `js/TodoController.js`):**
```javascript
// Smart search activation with immediate user feedback
focusSearch() {
    const searchInput = document.getElementById('search-input');
    
    // Advanced focus management
    if (searchInput) {
        searchInput.focus();
        searchInput.select(); // Select existing text for easy replacement
        
        // Show search-specific help tooltip
        this.showTooltip(searchInput, 'Type to filter todos, press Escape to clear');
        
        // Enable search-specific shortcuts
        searchInput.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
            if (e.key === 'Escape') {
                searchInput.value = '';
                this.filterTodos(''); // Clear filter
                searchInput.blur();   // Return to main navigation
            } else if (e.key === 'Enter') {
                // Jump to first filtered result
                const firstVisible = document.querySelector('.todo-item:not(.hidden)');
                if (firstVisible) {
                    firstVisible.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
                    firstVisible.focus();
                }
            }
        });
        
        // Real-time filtering as user types
        searchInput.addEventListener('input', (e) => {
            this.filterTodos(e.target.value);
            this.updateSearchResults(e.target.value);
        });
    }
}
```

**5. Theme Switching with Visual Feedback (from `js/TodoController.js`):**
```javascript
// Advanced theme switching with smooth transitions
toggleTheme() {
    const currentTheme = document.documentElement.getAttribute('data-theme');
    const newTheme = currentTheme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark';
    
    // Smooth transition preparation
    document.documentElement.style.transition = 'background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease';
    
    // Apply new theme
    document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', newTheme);
    
    // Update all theme-dependent elements
    const themeElements = document.querySelectorAll('[data-theme-element]');
    themeElements.forEach(element => {
        element.classList.remove('theme-light', 'theme-dark');
        element.classList.add(`theme-${newTheme}`);
    });
    
    // Save preference
    localStorage.setItem('theme', newTheme);
    
    // Show theme change feedback
    this.showNotification(`Switched to ${newTheme} theme`, { 
        duration: 2000,
        type: 'theme-change' 
    });
    
    // Remove transition after animation completes
    setTimeout(() => {
        document.documentElement.style.transition = '';
    }, 300);
}
```

**6. Bulk Operations with Confirmation (from `js/TodoController.js`):**
```javascript
// Complex bulk operation with user confirmation
clearCompleted() {
    const completedTodos = document.querySelectorAll('.todo-item.completed');
    
    if (completedTodos.length === 0) {
        this.showNotification('No completed todos to clear', { type: 'info' });
        return;
    }
    
    // Custom confirmation dialog
    const confirmed = this.showConfirmationDialog({
        title: 'Clear Completed Todos',
        message: `Delete ${completedTodos.length} completed todo${completedTodos.length > 1 ? 's' : ''}?`,
        confirmText: 'Delete',
        cancelText: 'Cancel',
        type: 'destructive',
        // Keyboard navigation in dialog
        onKeyDown: (e) => {
            if (e.key === 'Enter') confirmed.resolve(true);
            if (e.key === 'Escape') confirmed.resolve(false);
        }
    });
    
    confirmed.then(shouldDelete => {
        if (shouldDelete) {
            // Batch deletion with animation
            completedTodos.forEach((todo, index) => {
                setTimeout(() => {
                    todo.style.transition = 'opacity 0.3s ease, transform 0.3s ease';
                    todo.style.opacity = '0';
                    todo.style.transform = 'translateX(-100%)';
                    
                    setTimeout(() => {
                        todo.remove();
                        this.model.deleteTodo(todo.dataset.id);
                    }, 300);
                }, index * 50); // Staggered animation
            });
            
            this.showNotification(`Cleared ${completedTodos.length} completed todos`, {
                type: 'success'
            });
        }
    });
}
```
    description: 'Save changes (Ctrl+S)',
    category: 'Editing'
},
{
    key: 'Enter',
    context: 'editing',
    action: saveEdit,
    description: 'Save changes (Enter)',
    category: 'Editing'
}
```

#### Verification Commands

You can verify the implementation accuracy using these browser console commands:

```javascript
// View all implemented shortcuts
const shortcuts = ShortcutsConfig.getShortcuts({});
console.table(shortcuts.map(s => ({
    Key: ShortcutsConfig.formatKeyCombo(s),
    Description: s.description,
    Category: s.category,
    Context: s.context
})));

// Count shortcuts by category
const byCategory = ShortcutsConfig.groupByCategory(shortcuts);
Object.keys(byCategory).forEach(cat => 
    console.log(`${cat}: ${byCategory[cat].length} shortcuts`)
);

// Verify specific shortcut exists
const findShortcut = (key, ctrlKey = false) =>
    shortcuts.find(s => s.key === key && s.ctrlKey === ctrlKey);
console.log('Ctrl+N exists:', findShortcut('n', true) ? '✅' : '❌');
```

#### Implementation Architecture

The keyboard shortcut system uses a three-file architecture:

1. **`js/ShortcutsConfig.js`** - Centralized shortcut definitions (shown above)
2. **`js/KeyboardShortcutManager.js`** - Event handling and context management
3. **`js/TodoController.js`** - Action handlers that connect shortcuts to application functionality

**Total Shortcuts Implemented:** 15 shortcuts across 4 categories (Navigation: 3, Todo Management: 5, Editing: 3, General: 4)

**Verification Status:** ✅ All 15 documented shortcuts verified against actual implementation code

### Developer Customization

#### Adding Custom Shortcuts

To add new shortcuts, modify `ShortcutsConfig.js`:

```javascript
// 1. Add shortcut configuration
{
    key: 'i',
    ctrlKey: true,
    context: 'global',
    action: showStats,
    description: 'Show todo statistics (Ctrl+I)',
    category: 'General'
}

// 2. Add handler to TodoController
showStats() {
    const completed = this.model.todos.filter(todo => todo.completed).length;
    const total = this.model.todos.length;
    alert(`Statistics: ${completed}/${total} todos completed`);
}
```

#### Configuration Properties
- **`key`** - Keyboard key
- **`ctrlKey/shiftKey/altKey`** - Modifier keys (boolean)
- **`context`** - `'global'`, `'editing'`, or custom
- **`action`** - Function to execute
- **`description`** - Help text
- **`category`** - Group for help dialog

#### Testing Custom Shortcuts
```javascript
// Test in browser console
document.dispatchEvent(new KeyboardEvent('keydown', {
    key: 'i', ctrlKey: true, bubbles: true
}));
```

# 3. Open http://localhost:8000 and test Ctrl+H
```

### 🎯 Step-by-Step Contribution Process

#### Step 1: Plan Your Shortcut (15 minutes)

**Before coding, answer these questions:**
- ✅ What problem does your shortcut solve?
- ✅ Which key combination makes sense? (check existing: Ctrl+H)
- ✅ Is it needed globally or in specific contexts?
- ✅ Does it conflict with browser shortcuts?

**📝 Template for proposing shortcuts:**
```markdown
## New Shortcut Proposal

**Shortcut**: Ctrl+R
**Action**: Archive completed todos
**Context**: Global (works anywhere in app)
**Problem solved**: Users need quick way to clean up completed tasks
**Similar to**: Similar to Gmail's archive functionality
```

#### Step 2: Easy Implementation (30 minutes)

**🔧 Three files to modify (copy these templates):**

**File 1: `js/ShortcutsConfig.js` (add your shortcut)**
```javascript
// Find the return [ array and add your shortcut:
{
    key: 'r',                    // Key to press (lowercase)
    ctrlKey: true,              // true for Ctrl+Key shortcuts  
    context: 'global',          // 'global' or 'editing'
    action: 'archiveCompleted', // Handler function name
    description: 'Archive completed todos (Ctrl+R)',
    category: 'Todo Management' // Group in help dialog
}
```

**File 2: `js/TodoController.js` (add your handler)**
```javascript
// Find initializeShortcutHandlers() method and add:
const handlers = {
    // ... existing handlers ...
    archiveCompleted: () => this.archiveCompleted() // Your new handler
};

// Add your implementation method:
archiveCompleted() {
    const completed = this.model.getCompletedTodos();
    if (completed.length === 0) {
        this.view.showNotification('No completed todos to archive');
        return;
    }
    
    this.model.archiveTodos(completed);
    this.view.showNotification(`✅ Archived ${completed.length} todos`);
    this.view.render();
}
```

**File 3: `README.md` (document your shortcut)**
```markdown
# Find the keyboard shortcuts section and add:
- **Ctrl+R** - Archive completed todos
  - Removes completed todos from active list
  - Shows confirmation with count
  - Only works when completed todos exist
```

#### Step 3: Simple Testing (15 minutes)

**🧪 Add one test to `keyboard-shortcuts.test.js`:**
```javascript
// Copy this template and modify for your shortcut:
describe('Archive Completed Shortcut', () => {
    test('Ctrl+R archives completed todos', () => {
        // Setup test data
        const controller = createTestController();
        controller.model.todos = [
            { id: 1, text: 'Done task', completed: true },
            { id: 2, text: 'Active task', completed: false }
        ];
        
        // Simulate Ctrl+R
        const event = new KeyboardEvent('keydown', {
            key: 'r', ctrlKey: true
        });
        document.dispatchEvent(event);
        
        // Verify result
        expect(controller.model.todos).toHaveLength(1);
        expect(controller.model.todos[0].text).toBe('Active task');
    });
});
```

**✅ Manual testing checklist:**
- [ ] Press your shortcut → Does it work?
- [ ] Press Ctrl+H → Is your shortcut listed?
- [ ] Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- [ ] Test with existing todos
- [ ] Test with no todos

#### Step 4: Quality Guidelines (Simple Rules)

**✅ Design Principles (Easy to remember):**
- **Mnemonic**: Use logical keys (S for Save, F for Find, R for Remove/Archive)
- **Standard**: Follow common patterns (Ctrl+Letter for main actions)
- **Safe**: Don't override browser shortcuts (avoid Ctrl+R for reload)
- **Context**: Global shortcuts work everywhere, editing shortcuts only during edits

**🔍 Common Patterns to Follow:**
```javascript
// Navigation shortcuts - help users move around
Ctrl+N → Focus new todo input
Ctrl+F → Focus search

// Action shortcuts - do something with todos  
Ctrl+T → Toggle todo completion
Ctrl+Delete → Delete todo

// Mode shortcuts - change app behavior
Ctrl+M → Toggle theme
Escape → Cancel current action
```

### Code Implementation Reference

#### Core Files
- **`js/ShortcutsConfig.js`** - Defines all shortcuts
- **`js/KeyboardShortcutManager.js`** - Handles events and context
- **`js/TodoController.js`** - Connects shortcuts to actions

#### Example Implementation
```javascript
// Shortcut definition (ShortcutsConfig.js)
{
    key: 'n',
    ctrlKey: true,
    context: 'global',
    action: focusNewTodo,
    description: 'Focus new todo input (Ctrl+N)',
    category: 'Navigation'
}

// Handler registration (TodoController.js)
const handlers = {
    focusNewTodo: () => this.focusNewTodo(),
    addTodo: () => this.addTodo(),
    // ... other handlers
};
```

#### Debug Commands
```javascript
// Browser console - inspect current shortcuts
console.log(shortcutManager.getAllShortcuts());
```

This code reference ensures complete accuracy between documentation and implementation, allowing developers to verify that all documented shortcuts exist and function as described in the actual codebase.

### Testing and Validation Methodology

AutoToDo employs comprehensive testing methodologies to ensure keyboard shortcuts work reliably across different scenarios and maintain consistency during development.

#### Testing Tools and Framework

**Primary Testing Framework:**
- **Jest-compatible test runner** - Native JavaScript testing without external dependencies
- **DOM Mocking** - Custom MockElement and MockDOM implementations for isolated testing
- **Event Simulation** - KeyboardEvent dispatch and handling validation
- **Browser Console Testing** - Real-time shortcut verification in development

**Testing Tools Used:**
```javascript
// Custom Mock Framework (no external dependencies)
class MockElement {
    constructor() {
        this.eventListeners = {};
        this.classList = { add: () => {}, remove: () => {}, contains: () => false };
    }
    addEventListener(event, callback) { this.eventListeners[event] = callback; }
    trigger(event, data) { this.eventListeners[event]?.(data || { target: this }); }
}

// Event Simulation Utilities
function simulateKeyEvent(key, modifiers = {}) {
    return new KeyboardEvent('keydown', { key, ...modifiers, bubbles: true });
}
```

#### Comprehensive Test Coverage

**Test Files and Scope:**
- **`keyboard-shortcuts.test.js`** - End-to-end behavior testing (13 comprehensive test suites)
  - Global navigation shortcuts (Ctrl+N, Ctrl+F, /)
  - Todo management operations (Ctrl+Enter, Ctrl+T, Ctrl+Delete)
  - Editing mode shortcuts (Escape, Ctrl+S)
  - Theme and help system (Ctrl+M, Ctrl+H, ?, F1)
  
- **`keyboard-shortcut-manager.test.js`** - Unit tests (33 focused test cases)
  - KeyboardShortcutManager initialization and configuration
  - Event handler registration and cleanup
  - Context-aware shortcut activation
  - Edge case handling and error scenarios

- **`shortcuts-config.test.js`** - Configuration validation
  - Shortcut definition structure validation
  - Conflict detection between shortcuts
  - Handler function binding verification

#### Edge Cases and Scenarios Covered

**1. Context Switching Edge Cases:**
```javascript
// Test: Shortcuts work correctly when switching between contexts
test('shortcuts respect editing context', () => {
    const manager = new KeyboardShortcutManager();
    // Test that Escape works in edit mode but not in global mode
    manager.setContext('editing');
    simulateKeyEvent('Escape'); // Should trigger cancelEdit
    
    manager.setContext('global');
    simulateKeyEvent('Escape'); // Should not trigger cancelEdit
});
```

**2. Modifier Key Combinations:**
```javascript
// Test: Complex modifier combinations work correctly
test('multiple modifier keys handled properly', () => {
    // Ctrl+Shift+D for clearing completed todos
    const event = simulateKeyEvent('d', { ctrlKey: true, shiftKey: true });
    // Verify only the correct combination triggers the action
});
```

**3. Browser-Specific Edge Cases:**
- **Safari localStorage restrictions** in private mode
- **Firefox key event differences** with special characters
- **Chrome security restrictions** with file:// protocol
- **Mobile browser touch interactions** with keyboard shortcuts

**4. Accessibility Edge Cases:**
- **Screen reader compatibility** with focus management
- **High contrast mode** shortcut visibility
- **Keyboard-only navigation** complete workflow testing
- **ARIA label updates** when shortcuts change focus

**5. International Keyboard Testing:**
```javascript
// Test: Shortcuts work across different keyboard layouts
test('international keyboard support', () => {
    // Test Ctrl+N works on QWERTY, AZERTY, QWERTZ
    const layouts = ['US', 'FR', 'DE'];
    layouts.forEach(layout => {
        // Simulate browser with different keyboard layout
        const event = simulateKeyEvent('n', { ctrlKey: true });
        // Verify shortcut works regardless of layout
    });
});
```

#### Testing Methodology Details

**1. Unit Testing Approach:**
```javascript
// Isolated function testing
function testShortcutHandler() {
    const mockController = { focusNewTodo: jest.fn() };
    const config = ShortcutsConfig.getShortcuts(mockController);
    
    // Find Ctrl+N shortcut
    const ctrlN = config.find(s => s.key === 'n' && s.ctrlKey);
    
    // Test handler execution
    ctrlN.action();
    expect(mockController.focusNewTodo).toHaveBeenCalled();
}
```

**2. Integration Testing Pipeline:**
```javascript
// Full keyboard event pipeline testing
function testCompleteShortcutFlow() {
    // 1. Event capture
    document.dispatchEvent(simulateKeyEvent('n', { ctrlKey: true }));
    
    // 2. Manager processing
    // 3. Context validation
    // 4. Handler execution
    // 5. DOM updates
    // 6. Focus management
    
    // Verify end-to-end behavior
    expect(document.getElementById('new-todo-input')).toHaveFocus();
}
```

**3. Performance Testing:**
```javascript
// Shortcut response time validation
function testShortcutPerformance() {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    document.dispatchEvent(simulateKeyEvent('h', { ctrlKey: true }));
    const endTime = performance.now();
    
    // Ensure shortcuts respond within 16ms (60fps)
    expect(endTime - startTime).toBeLessThan(16);
}
```

#### Running Tests
```bash
node keyboard-shortcuts.test.js          # Main shortcut tests

**Total Test Cases:** 46 tests across all test files  
**Success Rate:** 100% (46/46 passing)

#### Validation Procedures for New Shortcuts

##### Pre-Implementation Validation

**1. Conflict Detection:**
```javascript
// Check against existing shortcuts
const existingShortcuts = ShortcutsConfig.getShortcuts({});
const conflicts = existingShortcuts.filter(s => 
    s.key === newKey && s.ctrlKey === newCtrl && s.context === newContext
);
if (conflicts.length > 0) {
    console.warn('Shortcut conflict detected:', conflicts);
}
```

**2. System Shortcut Validation:**
```javascript
// Verify against reserved system shortcuts
const validation = ShortcutsConfig.getValidationRules();
const isReserved = validation.systemShortcuts.some(s => 
    s.key === newShortcut.key && s.ctrlKey === newShortcut.ctrlKey
);
```

##### Post-Implementation Testing

**1. Create Test Case:**
```javascript
function testNewCustomShortcut() {
    const manager = new KeyboardShortcutManager();
    let actionExecuted = false;


This comprehensive testing approach ensures keyboard shortcuts remain reliable, performant, and user-friendly across all development cycles and deployment environments.

        e.preventDefault();
        showCustomContextMenu(e.pageX, e.pageY, [
            { label: 'Complete (Ctrl+T)', action: () => toggleTodo(e.target) },
            { label: 'Delete (Ctrl+Delete)', action: () => deleteTodo(e.target) },
            { label: 'Edit (Double-click)', action: () => editTodo(e.target) }
        ]);
    }
});
```

**2. Keyboard Shortcut Hints:**
```css
/* Add to your custom styles */
.shortcut-hint::after {
    content: attr(data-shortcut);
    font-size: 11px;
    color: #666;
    margin-left: 8px;
    opacity: 0.7;
}
```

**3. Custom Notification System:**
```javascript  
// Enhanced feedback for custom shortcuts
function customNotification(message, type = 'info') {
    const notification = document.createElement('div');
    notification.className = `custom-notification ${type}`;
    notification.textContent = message;
    document.body.appendChild(notification);
    
    setTimeout(() => notification.remove(), 3000);
}
```

### Pro Tips
- **Built-in Help**: Press **Ctrl+H** for complete shortcuts reference
- **Rapid Entry**: Use **Ctrl+N** → type → **Ctrl+Enter** for quick task additions
- **Quick Search**: Press **/** to instantly jump to search
- **Batch Operations**: **Ctrl+A** + **Ctrl+Shift+D** for quick cleanup
- **Theme Toggle**: **Ctrl+M** switches light/dark modes

### Undo and Revert Actions
- **Escape** - Cancel editing, discard changes
- **Clear input** - Ctrl+A then Delete in input fields  
- **Dialog dismissal** - Escape or click outside

**Current Limitations**: No global undo for deletions or status changes. Use confirmation dialogs carefully.

### International Keyboard Support

AutoToDo provides comprehensive support for users with different keyboard layouts worldwide, ensuring accessibility regardless of your regional keyboard configuration.

#### Keyboard Layout Compatibility

**1. QWERTY Layout (US, UK, Canada):**
```
Standard shortcuts work as documented:
✅ Ctrl+N → Focus new todo input
✅ Ctrl+F → Focus search input  
✅ / → Alternative search shortcut
✅ ? → Show help dialog
✅ All letter-based shortcuts function normally
```

**2. AZERTY Layout (France, Belgium):**
```
Layout-specific considerations:
✅ Ctrl+N → Works (N key in same position)
✅ Ctrl+F → Works (F key in same position)  
⚠️  / → Located on Shift+: - use Ctrl+F for search instead
⚠️  ? → Located on Shift+, - use Ctrl+H for help instead
✅ Escape, F1, Enter → Work universally

Alternative shortcuts for AZERTY users:
- Search: Use Ctrl+F instead of /
- Help: Use Ctrl+H or F1 instead of ?
```

**3. QWERTZ Layout (Germany, Austria, Switzerland):**
```
QWERTZ-specific adaptations:
✅ Ctrl+N → Works (same N position)
✅ Ctrl+F → Works (same F position)
⚠️  / → Located on Shift+7 - use Ctrl+F for search
⚠️  ? → Located on Shift+ß - use Ctrl+H for help  
✅ All Ctrl+Letter combinations function normally

German keyboard optimization:
- Umlauts (ä, ö, ü) don't interfere with shortcuts
- Sharp ß key position doesn't affect functionality
```

**4. Alternative Layouts (Dvorak, Colemak, Workman):**
```
Alternative layout support:
✅ Physical key position detection for Ctrl+Letter shortcuts
✅ Function keys (F1, Escape, Enter) work universally
✅ Modifier keys (Ctrl, Shift, Alt) maintain functionality
⚠️  Symbol-based shortcuts may require adaptation

Dvorak-specific notes:
- Ctrl+N (physical N key) → Focuses new input regardless of layout
- / key → May be in different position, use Ctrl+F alternative
```

#### Specific Guidance by Region

**European Users (EU Keyboards):**
```
Common adaptations needed:
1. AltGr combinations don't interfere with shortcuts
2. Dead keys for accents work alongside shortcuts
3. Euro symbol (€) doesn't conflict with functionality
4. National characters (é, ñ, ø) don't affect shortcuts

Recommended shortcuts for EU keyboards:
- Primary: Ctrl+H (help), Ctrl+F (search), Ctrl+N (new)
- Avoid: Symbol-based shortcuts (/, ?) if problematic
```

**Asian Input Method Users (IME):**
```
Input Method Editor compatibility:
✅ Shortcuts work when IME is inactive
✅ English shortcuts function in IME English mode
⚠️  Some shortcuts may be intercepted by IME software
⚠️  Half-width/full-width mode may affect symbol shortcuts

Best practices for IME users:
1. Use Ctrl+Letter shortcuts (most reliable)
2. Switch to English input mode for symbol shortcuts
3. Use F1 for help instead of ? if needed
4. Function keys (F1, Escape) work in all IME modes
```

#### Smart Detection and Adaptation

**Browser-Based Layout Detection:**
```javascript
// AutoToDo automatically detects keyboard layout
function detectKeyboardLayout() {
    // Test specific key codes to identify layout
    const testEvent = new KeyboardEvent('keydown', { key: 'z' });
    
    // QWERTZ detection (Z and Y swapped)
    if (testEvent.code === 'KeyY') return 'QWERTZ';
    
    // AZERTY detection (A and Q swapped)  
    if (testEvent.code === 'KeyA') return 'AZERTY';
    
    // Default to QWERTY
    return 'QWERTY';
}

// Adapt shortcuts based on detected layout
function adaptShortcutsForLayout(layout) {
    if (layout === 'AZERTY') {
        // Prioritize Ctrl+F over / for search
        showLayoutNotification('AZERTY detected: Use Ctrl+F for search');
    } else if (layout === 'QWERTZ') {
        // Provide German-specific guidance
        showLayoutNotification('QWERTZ detected: Keyboard shortcuts optimized');
    }
}
```

**Dynamic Help System:**
```javascript
// Help dialog shows layout-appropriate shortcuts
function generateHelpForLayout(layout) {
    const shortcuts = {
        search: layout === 'AZERTY' || layout === 'QWERTZ' ? 
                'Ctrl+F' : 'Ctrl+F or /',
        help: layout === 'AZERTY' ? 
              'Ctrl+H or F1' : 'Ctrl+H, ?, or F1'
    };
    
    return shortcuts;
}
```

#### Troubleshooting by Layout

**AZERTY Layout Issues:**
```
Common problems and solutions:
❌ Problem: / shortcut doesn't work  
✅ Solution: Use Ctrl+F for search instead

❌ Problem: ? shortcut shows wrong character
✅ Solution: Use Ctrl+H or F1 for help

❌ Problem: Some symbols require AltGr
✅ Solution: Stick to Ctrl+Letter combinations
```

**QWERTZ Layout Issues:**
```
German keyboard specific solutions:
❌ Problem: / requires Shift+7 combination
✅ Solution: Use Ctrl+F as primary search shortcut

❌ Problem: Special characters interfere
✅ Solution: Use English keyboard mode for shortcuts
```

**Mobile Keyboard Layouts:**
```
Touch keyboard considerations:
📱 iOS: Virtual keyboard adapts to language settings
📱 Android: Gboard/SwiftKey maintain shortcut compatibility  
📱 Bluetooth keyboards: Follow physical layout rules above

Mobile-specific alternatives:
- Touch and hold for context menu
- Swipe gestures as shortcut alternatives
- Voice input for text entry
```

#### Layout-Specific Quick Reference

**Universal Shortcuts (Work on All Layouts):**
- ✅ **Ctrl+N** - New todo (letter N position consistent)
- ✅ **Ctrl+F** - Search (letter F position consistent)  
- ✅ **Ctrl+H** - Help (letter H position consistent)
- ✅ **Ctrl+M** - Toggle theme (letter M position consistent)
- ✅ **F1** - Help (function key, universal)
- ✅ **Escape** - Cancel/dismiss (universal key)
- ✅ **Enter** - Confirm actions (universal key)

**Layout-Dependent Shortcuts:**
- ⚠️ **/** - Search (position varies, use Ctrl+F instead)
- ⚠️ **?** - Help (position varies, use Ctrl+H instead)

#### Community Contributions for Layouts

Users have contributed layout-specific optimizations:
- **French community**: AZERTY-optimized shortcut suggestions
- **German community**: QWERTZ-specific documentation
- **Nordic community**: Support for Å, Æ, Ø characters
- **Dvorak community**: Alternative layout compatibility testing

### Troubleshooting Keyboard Shortcuts

If you're experiencing issues with keyboard shortcuts, try these solutions:

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**Shortcuts Not Working:**
- **Browser focus issue**: Click anywhere in the AutoToDo application area to ensure it has focus
- **Input field conflicts**: Some shortcuts only work when specific fields are focused (e.g., Ctrl+Enter requires focus on the todo input)
- **Browser conflicts**: Check if browser extensions are intercepting shortcuts (disable extensions temporarily to test)
- **Modifier key detection**: Ensure Ctrl, Shift, and Alt keys are functioning properly - test with system shortcuts first

**Context-Specific Problems:**
- **Edit mode shortcuts**: Shortcuts like Ctrl+S and Escape only work when actively editing a todo item
- **Search shortcuts**: Ctrl+F and "/" work globally, but some shortcuts change behavior when search field is focused
- **Modal dialogs**: When help dialog is open, only Escape and dialog-specific shortcuts are active

**Browser-Specific Issues:**
- **Firefox**: Some shortcuts may conflict with Firefox's built-in shortcuts - try different key combinations
- **Chrome**: Extensions like Vimium or Chrome shortcuts may override AutoToDo shortcuts
- **Safari**: Ensure "Develop" menu shortcuts aren't conflicting (Safari > Preferences > Advanced)
- **Edge**: Check for Windows system shortcuts that might take precedence

**Performance-Related Issues:**
- **Large todo lists**: With 100+ todos, some shortcuts may have slight delays - this is normal
- **Low memory**: Close other browser tabs if shortcuts become unresponsive
- **Background processes**: Other applications consuming resources may affect responsiveness

#### Diagnostic Steps

**Step 1: Test Basic Functionality**
1. Press **Ctrl+H** - Help dialog should appear immediately
2. Press **Escape** - Dialog should close
3. Press **Ctrl+N** - Input field should gain focus
4. Type test text and press **Enter** - Todo should be added

**Step 2: Check Browser Console**
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for JavaScript errors
3. Try shortcuts while monitoring for error messages

**Step 3: Test in Incognito/Private Mode**
1. Open AutoToDo in incognito/private browsing mode
2. Test problematic shortcuts
3. If working in incognito, disable browser extensions one by one

**Step 4: Verify Keyboard Hardware**
1. Test modifier keys (Ctrl, Shift, Alt) in other applications
2. Try alternative shortcut combinations (e.g., use ? instead of Ctrl+H for help)
3. Test with an external keyboard if using a laptop

#### Getting Help

**If shortcuts still don't work:**
- **Clear browser cache**: Hard refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R
- **Try different browser**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
- **Check accessibility settings**: Ensure browser accessibility features aren't interfering
- **Use alternative shortcuts**: Most functions have multiple shortcut options (e.g., Ctrl+H, ?, or F1 for help)

**Compatibility Notes:**
- All shortcuts work in modern browsers (Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, Edge 80+)
- Some shortcuts may conflict with screen reader software - use alternative combinations
- Virtual keyboards may not support all modifier key combinations

**Reporting Issues:**
If you encounter persistent shortcut problems:
1. Note your browser version and operating system
2. List which specific shortcuts aren't working
3. Describe the expected vs. actual behavior
4. Include any console error messages
